### This is an example Makefile and it MUST be configured to suit your needs.
### For detailled explanations about all the avalaible options,
### please refer to https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile/blob/master/arduino-mk-vars.md

### PROJECT_DIR
### This is the path to where you have created/cloned your project
PROJECT_DIR = /home/mitchell/senior-design/ardupilot-arduino/arduP
### ARDUINO_DIR
### Path to the Arduino application and ressources directory.
ARDUINO_DIR = /usr/share/arduino
### AVR_GCC_VERSION
### Check if the version is equal or higher than 4.9
AVR_GCC_VERSION := $(shell expr `avr-gcc -dumpversion | cut -f1` \>= 4.9)
### ARDMK_DIR
### Path to the Arduino-Makefile directory.
ARDMK_DIR = $(ARDUINO_DIR)
### USER_LIB_PATH
### Path to where the your project's libraries are stored.
USER_LIB_PATH := $(realpath $(PROJECT_DIR)/lib)
### BOARD_TAG & BOARD_SUB
### It must be set to the board you are currently using. (i.e uno, mega, etc.)
### For the Arduino Uno, only BOARD_TAG is mandatory and BOARD_SUB can be equal to anything
### For the Arduino Mega2560, BOARD_SUB is also needed
BOARD_TAG = uno
BOARD_SUB = atmega2560
### MONITOR_BAUDRATE
### It must be set to Serial baudrate value you are using.
MONITOR_BAUDRATE = 115200
### AVR_TOOLS_DIR
### Path to the AVR tools directory such as avr-gcc, avr-g++, etc.
AVR_TOOLS_DIR = /usr
### AVRDDUDE
### Path to avrdude directory.

### CFLAGS_STD
CFLAGS_STD = -std=gnu11
### CXXFLAGS_STD
CXXFLAGS_STD = -std=gnu++11
### CPPFLAGS
### Flags you might want to set for debugging purpose. Comment to stop.
CXXFLAGS = -Wall #-Wextra #-pedantic
### If avr-gcc -v is higher than 4.9, activate coloring of the output
ifeq "$(AVR_GCC_VERSION)" "1"
	CXXFLAGS += -fdiagnostics-color
endif
### MONITOR_PORT
### The port your board is connected to. Using an '*' tries all the ports and finds the right one.
MONITOR_PORT = /dev/tty.usbmodem*
### don't touch this
CURRENT_DIR = $(shell basename $(CURDIR))
### OBJDIR
### This is were you put the binaries you just compile using 'make'
CURRENT_DIR = $(shell basename $(CURDIR))
OBJDIR = $(PROJECT_DIR)/bin/$(CURRENT_DIR)/$(BOARD_TAG)
### path to Arduino.mk, inside the ARDMK_DIR, don't touch.
include $(ARDMK_DIR)/Arduino.mk
